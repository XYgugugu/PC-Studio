**Indexing**
#### Query 1:

##### EXPLAIN ANALYZE
![](./imgs/advSQL_explain_analyze1.png)
##### Index to ```Storage.NVME```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index1_1.png)
The cost of ```Filter``` reduces from 106.50 to 67.10. Without this index, a full table scan is required to check every ```Storage.NVME``` to see if it is ```True``` while this index allows the query to directly find those are desired, ```NVME=True```, as the result, the cost is reduced by fewer row access.

##### Index to ```Storage.Capacity```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index2_1.png)
There does not appear any improvement with this indexinyg as the cost remains at 106.50. This is likely due to the comparision to ```AVG(Capcity)``` in subquery, resulting a need for full table scan, nothing can be narrow down in this case.

##### Index to ```Storage.Manufacturer```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index3_1.png)
The cost is significantly reduced from 106.50 to 32.89 with this indexing. Firstly, at Index scan on Storage, the cost is now 29.77 when grouping entries using ```Manufacturer```. Secondly, the sub-query can also be benefited where ```S2.Manufacturer = Storage.Manufacturer``` can find matches more quickly just like the case of ```NVME``` directly finding those are ```True```, as a result, the aggregation cost drops from 23.30 to 9.36 and table scan of 12.90 to index lookup with 7.28 

##### Selected index: ```Storage.Manufacturer```
The cost with this index is the lowest. Among the 3 attributes (```Storage.NVME```, ```Storage.Capacity```, ```Storage.Manufacturer```), its high cardinality helps reduce cost for search, especially with the query grouping entries by it, comparing to *NVME*, boolean, which also reduces the cost, but not that significant. While, as discussed earlier, ```Storage.Capacity``` does not help, resulting the most optimal choice being ```Storage.Manufacturer```

#### Query 2:

##### EXPLAIN ANALYZE
![](./imgs/advSQL_explain_analyze2.png)

##### Index to ```Motherboard.Manufacturer```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index1_2.png)
Tried adding index to ```Motherboard.Manufacturer```, because it is an attribute used in where statement in subquery. Turns out decreased the cost from 9565.08 to 2009.99. Result suggests this is by now the best indexing.

##### Index to ```CPU.CPU_Socket```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index2_2.png)
Tried adding index to ```CPU.CPU_Socket```, because it is an attribute used in join-on two tables. Turns out decreased the cost from 9565.08 to 2009.99. Result suggests this has the same effect as indexing ```Motherboard.Manufacturer```.

##### Index to ```Motherboard.Socket```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index3_2.png)
Tried adding index to ```Motherboard.Socket```, because it is an attribute used in join-on two tables similar to ```CPU.CPU_Socket```. Turns out the cost is reduced from 9565.08 to 1112.40. Result suggests this is by now the best indexing.

##### Index to ```CPU.Core_Count```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index4_2.png)
Tried adding index to ```CPU.Core_Count```, because it is an attribute used in where statement. But turns out it does not increased the cost but rather increase a tiny bit to 9577.29. Result suggests this is obviously not the best indexing.

##### Index to ```CPU.Thread_Count```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index5_2.png)
Tried adding index to ```CPU.Thread_Count```, because it is an attribute used in where statement. But turns out it does not increased the cost but rather increase a tiny bit to 9579.69. Result suggests this is obviously not the best indexing.

##### Selected index: ```Motherboard.Socket```
Results suggests the cost with this index is the lowest among all the 5 attributes (```Motherboard.Manufacturer```, ```CPU.CPU_Socket```, ```Motherboard.Socket```, ```CPU.Core_Count```, ```CPU.Thread_Count```) listed above. Indexing it help reduce cost for join-on, comparing to indexing the other join-on attribute (```CPU.CPU_Socket```) or the where attribute (```Motherboard.Manufacturer```), indexing ```Motherboard.Socket``` has a higher amount of decreasing. On the other hand, indexing the rest two attributes (```CPU.Core_Count```, ```CPU.Thread_Count```) both increased the cost by a tiny amount, so considering all the facts above, indexing (```Motherboard.Socket```) is the best indexing design.

#### Query 3:


##### EXPLAIN ANALYZE
![](./imgs/advSQL_explain_analyze3.png)


##### Index to ```CPU.Manufacturer```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index1_3.png)
With the index of ```Manufacturer```, the cost of these operations remain the same since we just output these values and haven't used these columns for operation performance. It is not involved in filtering, joining, etc such operations which will be benefited from index. It won't help optimize the cost for scanning and nested inner join loop or directly affect the performance.


##### Index to ```CPU.TDP ```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index2_3.png)
With the index of ```CPU.TDP ```, the cost of the operations remain the same except the filter which finds the CPU with TDP above the average. For this filter, the cost increase from 35.46 to 98.40. It could be due to the additional overhead estimated using the index of ```CPU.TDP ```. And since this index isnt highly selective to help skip many of the rows. It therefore become less efficient.


##### Index to ```CPU.CPU_Socket``` 
![](./imgs/advSQL_index3_3.png)
With the index of ```CPU.CPU_Socket ```, the cost of table scan significantly decrease from 31209 to 12626. This is because the query is filter by joining on ```CPU.CPU_Socket``` = ```Motherboard.Socket```. It allows the database to quickly find the matching rows without scanning the entire table and therefore reduces the number of rows it has to process during the scan.


##### Index to ```Motherboard.Manufacturer```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index4_3.png)
Similar to ```CPU.Manufacturer```, the cost of these operations remains the same since we just output these values and haven't used these columns for operation performance. It won't help optimize the cost for scanning or nested inner join loop and cannot directly affect the performance.


##### Index to ```Motherboard.Socket```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index5_3.png)
With the index of ```Motherboard.Socket```, the cost of table scan significantly decrease from 31209 to 5569. This is because the query is filter by joining on ```CPU.CPU_Socket``` = ```Motherboard.Socket```. It allows the database to quickly find the matching rows without scanning the entire table and therefore reduces the number of rows it has to process during the scan.


##### Selected index: ```Motherboard.Socket```
The final index design should be for ```Motherboard.Socket```. This index significantly reduced the cost of scanning the entire Motherboard table. Indexing ```Motherboard.Socket``` allows the database to quickly match rows in both tables and therefore improve the efficiency.

#### Query 4:

##### EXPLAIN ANALYZE
![](./imgs/advSQL_explain_analyze4.png)


##### Index to ```CPU.TDP```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index1_4.png)
The cost of limit, sort, filter, and scan of union temporary, however, increases significantly. For example, the cost of limit and sort increase from 225.23 to 304.39. It is due to the duplication in order and union operation. Since in this query, no nested inner loop join is needed, adding such index cannot optimize the operation cost. ```CPU.TDP``` could also often duplicate value. If the index doesn't cover the specific query requirements, using an index could result in greater cost.


##### Index to ```GPU.TDP```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index2_4.png)
Similar to ```CPU.TDP```, the cost of these operations significantly increases. or example, the cost of limit and sort increase from 225.23 to 304.39.  Since there is no nested inner loop required, adding index in this query isn't a optimized choice and even increase the overhead during scanning. 


##### Index to ```CPU.Manufacturer ```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index3_4.png)
With the index of ```Manufacturer```, the cost of these operations remain the same since we just output these values and haven't used these columns for operation performance. It won't help optimize the scanning and nested inner join loop.


##### Index to ```GPU.Manufacturer ```
![](./imgs/advSQL_index4_4.png)
Similar to ```CPU.Manufacturer```, the cost of these operations remain the same since the index of ```Manufacturer``` cannot directly affect the performance of the query. 

##### Selected index: ```None```
Based on the analysis, we shouldn't add any indexes for this query. Indicec on ```TDP``` further increased the cost from 225.23 to over 300 due to the duplication in order and union operation and the additional overhead of maintaining and scanning the indexes. ```TDP``` values can be duplicated, so adding index on ```TDP``` isn't a good choice. For the index on ```Manufacturer```, since ```Manufacturer``` values are used only in select operation and not involved in filtering, joining such operations which will be benefited from index, the index for manufacturer cann't directly affect the performance. Therefore, adding index on manufacturer isn't a good choice and even increase the cost of maintaining and scanning the index.
